## User Guide

The goal of this action is to facilitate sending events to an AWS EventBridge
EventBus. To do so, you need to configure the action like so:

```yaml
- name: Configure AWS Credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@master
  with:
    role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.ROLE }}  # needs permissions to write to the event bus
- uses: tshauck/gh-action-event-to-aws-eventbridge@v0.1.0
  with:
    event_bus_name: 'tshauck-gh-action-event-to-aws-eventbridge'
```

`event_bus_name` is the only required parameter. Generally, your options are:

| parameter | default |
| ---- | ----- |
| event_bus_name | |
| detail_type | `GitHub Action Event` |
| source | `gh.event` |
| detail | github.context.payload's value |

For more information see:

* [GitHub Repo Events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows)
* [EventBridge Homepage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/)

### AWS Permissions

The role associated with your authentication mechanism needs to be able to
put events to the bus in question. It's recommended you use AWS's action
[here](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials).

For example of this in action, see the `merge.yml` workflow in this repo.
